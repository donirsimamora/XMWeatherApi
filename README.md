To switch to OpenWeatherMap

Add your API key to appsettings.json 
OpenWeather__ApiKey . , put your ApiKey in there.
Register OpenWeatherService in Program.cs instead of MockWeatherService .

Notes, 

Dew point: OpenWeather's free current-weather endpoint does not provide dew point directly; 
For production compute dew point from temp & humidity using a standard formula. 
For the mock
Service we return a mocked dew point; extend OpenWeatherService to compute a true dew
point.
Consider caching upstream weather responses with IMemoryCache to avoid hitting external API
limits.
Frontend is intentionally minimal: no framework, plain JS fetch calls.
